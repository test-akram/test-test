AI News Aggregator: Stay Updated with the Latest AI News

During a competition, our team worked diligently to create an AI News Aggregator platform using Django, Scrapy, asyncio, and Selenium. The objective of the project was to scrape the internet and gather the most recent news articles on artificial intelligence (AI), organizing them by date and subject.

By combining the power of Django's web framework, Scrapy's web scraping capabilities, asyncio's asynchronous programming, and Selenium's automated browser interactions, we were able to develop a robust and efficient platform for collecting and categorizing AI news.

The platform utilizes web scraping techniques to crawl various news websites, extract relevant articles, and store them in a structured manner based on their publication date and subject. Users can easily browse through the aggregated news articles, search for specific topics, and stay updated with the latest developments in the AI field.

The integration of asyncio and Selenium ensures efficient and rapid scraping, allowing the platform to handle large amounts of data effectively. Additionally, Django provides a user-friendly interface for managing and presenting the collected news articles.
