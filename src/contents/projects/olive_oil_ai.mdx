AI for Olive Oil Quality Detection in collaboration with Oil4Med Association

In this project, I have collaborated with Oil4Med Association to develop an AI system using TensorFlow, a popular machine learning library, for olive oil quality detection. The goal of the project is to analyze the fluorescence spectrum of olive oil and provide fast and accurate results.

Working closely with the experts from Oil4Med Association, we trained a Conv1D model on a large dataset of fluorescence spectra to enable the AI model to identify various quality parameters of olive oil. This includes assessing freshness, purity, and detecting potential contaminants. By leveraging the power of machine learning, we aim to enhance the quality control process in the olive oil industry.

The use of TensorFlow and Conv1D allows our AI model to efficiently process the fluorescence spectrum data and make predictions rapidly. Our collaboration with Oil4Med Association has been instrumental in ensuring the project's success, as their domain expertise in olive oil quality assessment has guided the development process.
