A mechanical simulation project aimed at analyzing and visualizing various mechanical systems.

The purpose of this project is to simulate and study mechanical systems using computational methods. The simulation software is developed using Python programming language and leverages libraries such as NumPy for numerical computations, Matplotlib for data visualization, and Pygame for interactive simulations.

The project focuses on implementing physics-based models to simulate the behavior of mechanical systems, including particles, rigid bodies, springs, and other physical elements. It enables users to define the properties of the system, apply external forces, and observe the resulting motion and interactions.

By providing a user-friendly interface and customizable simulation parameters, this project aims to facilitate the analysis and understanding of mechanical systems. It serves as a tool for researchers, engineers, and students interested in exploring and experimenting with various mechanical phenomena.
