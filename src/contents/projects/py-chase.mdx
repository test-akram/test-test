PyChase is a game created using Python and Pygame. In this game, the player is placed in a maze and is constantly chased by a monster. The monster is programmed to find the player immediately and calculate the shortest path using the A* algorithm. The player's objective is to exit the maze before the monster catches them or the time runs out.

The game provides an exciting and challenging experience as the player navigates through the maze, looking for the exit while avoiding the pursuing monster. The maze layout may vary for each playthrough, ensuring a different challenge each time.
