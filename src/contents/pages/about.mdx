## About Me

I'm an ICT engineering student at [ENISo](http://www.eniso.rnu.tn/fr/) in Tunisia. I have a passion for technology and enjoy working on various projects related to software engineering. As a freelancer, I've worked on a variety of projects using different platforms such as Upwork, PPH, and Fiverr. I've worked on projects in various fields, including artificial intelligence solutions, reinforcement learning, and full-stack web development.

During my internship at Tunisie Telecom, I had the opportunity to work on a full-stack web application that was highly scalable. I used Django, a high-level Python web framework, along with various visual libraries and TailwindCSS to develop the application. I also gained experience working with DRF (Django Rest Framework) to build a RESTful API for the application.
